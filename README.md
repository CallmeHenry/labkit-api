## Collaborators

### Cloning for the first time

We're working from the <i>dev</i> branch. Each issue, feature, etc., is branched from the 'dev' branch, <b>not</b> <i>
main</i>. Once completed with your task, submit a pull request.

1. `git clone -b <branch name> <url>`

2. `git pull origin dev`

For example, issue #23: `git clone -b 23-update-readme-for-collaborators https://github.com/CallmeHenry/labkit-api`

### Receiving a new issue

Make sure you're assigned to one, each issue has their own branch.

1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git checkout <branch name>`

For example, if you're working on issue #23 `git checkout 23-update-readme-for-collaborators`
